# Vehicle-Routing-Problem-Approximations-Using-Wisdom-of-Artifical-Crowds-with-Genetic-Algorithms
I am working on publishing a paper on approximating solutions to the Vehicle Routing Problem using Wisdom of Artificial Crowds with Genetic Algorithms.  This is a continuation of work started in Professor Roman Yampolskiy's [Artificial Intelligence](https://github.com/jtcass01/AI) class.

## [Current State of Paper](https://github.com/jtcass01/Vehicle-Routing-Problem-Approximations-Using-Wisdom-of-Artifical-Crowds-with-Genetic-Algorithms/blob/master/IEEE_VRP_Approximations_Using_WoAC_With_GA.pdf)
