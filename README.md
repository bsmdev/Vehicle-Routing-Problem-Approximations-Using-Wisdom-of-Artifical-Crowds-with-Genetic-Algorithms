# Vehicle-Routing-Problem-Approximations-Using-Wisdom-of-Artifical-Crowds-with-Genetic-Algorithms
I am working on publishing a paper on approximating solutions to the Vehicle Routing Problem using Genetic Algorithms.  This is a continuation of work started in Professor Roman Yampolskiy's Artificial Intelligence class.
